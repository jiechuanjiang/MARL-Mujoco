# MARL-Mujoco

## What is it?
We implement some popular multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms on Mujoco using tensorflow and keras, to investigate the difference between CTCE, CTDE, and DTDE. Here, we assume the agents could obtain the full state of the environment and do not consider the influence of partial observation.

## What is included?
As of today, the following algorithms have been implemented:
- [x] MADDPG
- [x] DOP
- [ ] MASAC
- [ ] IA2C
